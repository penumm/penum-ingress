## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Core architecture implementation
- ✅ Transaction envelope standardization
- ✅ Deterministic batching engine
- ✅ Commit-reveal pipeline
- ✅ Relay forwarding layer
- ✅ Privacy-safe observability
- ✅ Basic documentation

## Phase 2: Security & Testing (Q1 2025)
- ✅ Security audit of cryptographic components
- 🔄 Extensive Foundry testing
- 🔄 Off-chain analysis for correlation probability
- 🔄 Performance benchmarking
- 🔄 Formal verification of critical components

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Deployment (Q2 2025)
- 🔄 Production-ready ingress nodes
- 🔄 Monitoring and observability systems
- 🔄 Load testing and scalability validation
- 🔄 Integration testing with major MEV relays
- 🔄 Multi-region deployment

## Phase 4: Advanced Privacy (Q3 2025)
- 🔄 Advanced batching algorithms
- 🔄 Enhanced privacy metrics and measurement
- 🔄 Adaptive batch sizing based on network conditions
- 🔄 Integration with additional relay networks
- 🔄 Privacy-preserving transaction aggregation

## Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration (Q4 2025)
- 🔄 Integration with major wallet providers
- 🔄 Partnership with DeFi protocols
- 🔄 Enterprise solutions for exchanges
- 🔄 API gateway for developers
- 🔄 SDKs for multiple programming languages

## Long-term Goals (2026+)
